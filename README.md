# Predict-Portfolio-Returns-by-Autoencoder-Model-
I constructed below autoencoder models. There are two inputs. The left side is beta exposure, the righ side is factor returns. After walking through multiple layers, I dotted the outputs of the two sides. I trained the model to let the dotted outputs equal to real f=portfolio returns.
